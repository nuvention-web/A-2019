# NUVention Team A

Directions to run the project.

First you need to clone our code.

```
git clone https://github.com/nuvention-web/A-2019.git
```

Then you need to checkout to our **mobile** branch.

```
git checkout mobile
```

Install all the package that you need:

```
npm i
```

Install Expo:

```
npm install expo-cli --global
```

Start Expo:

```
expo start
```

Then you have two options, whether to start the app simulator on your computer or install the app on your phone.

1. Start the app simulator

* Once you start Expo, you can press "**i**" to open the iso simulator on your computer, and it might takes some time to load it.

2. Install the app on your phone

* First you need to download the "Expo" from your app store, and then you type command "expo login" at your terminal.

```
expo login
```

* Then, you start the server:

```
expo start
```

* And then you can see the project on your phone. And you just need to click on that, then you can see the app on your phone.
