4. Install Expo:

Here you have two options, whether to start the app simulator on your computer or install the app on your phone.

1. Start the app simulator

* Once you start Expo, you can press "**i**" to open the iso simulator on your computer, and it might takes some time to load it.

2. Install the app on your phone

* First you need to download the "Expo" from your app store, and then you type command "expo login" at your terminal.

```sh
$ expo login
```

* Then, you start the server:

```sh
$ expo start
```

* And then you can see the project on your phone. And you just need to click on that, then you can see the app on your phone.
